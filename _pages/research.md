**Testing for Almost Stochastic Dominance** (with [Yoon-Jae Whang][whangyj]). 2022. <br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('ATSD')">Abstract</a> | [Draft][ATSD_draft] ]</small>

<div id="ATSD" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
We propose a nonparametric test for the null hypothesis of almost stochastic dominance (ASD). The traditional stochastic dominance (SD) rule ranks distributions for <i>all</i> utility functions in a certain class, which can be restrictive in practice. To circumvent the limitation of the SD rule, Leshno and Levy (2002) developed the ASD rule that applies to <i>most</i> rather than <i>all</i> decision makers by eliminating economically pathological preferences. The ASD rule can be applied to many empirical economic problems including investment decisions and policy evaluations. Despite its usefulness, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no formal test of ASD available in the literature. In this paper, we propose an $L_{p}$-type test statistic based on empirical distribution functions and introduce bootstrap procedures to compute the critical values. We investigate the finite sample performance of the testing procedures by a set of Monte Carlo simulation experiments. We apply our test to compare the return distributions of stocks and bonds over different investment horizons. The ASD tests support the popular practice of adjusting the portfolios of stocks and bonds based on the investment horizons.

**Diagnostic Global Game: Theory and Experiment** (with [Syngjoo Choi][choisj] and [Jeongbin Kim][kimjb]). 2022. <br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('DGG')">Abstract</a> | [Draft][DGG_draft] ]</small>

<div id="DGG" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
We introduce diagnostic expectations into a standard coordination game with incomplete information called global game. Diagnostic expectations proposed by Bordalo et al. (2018) capture excess volatility in belief updating. The equilibrium threshold and uniqueness conditions change compared with the benchmark global game with Bayesian updating due to diagnosticity. We test diagnostic expectations in a belief updating problem and predictions of the diagnostic global game model experimentally. In our experimental design, we include a novel treatment to capture the mechanism behind diagnostic expectation, motivated by the micro-foundation of diagnostic expectations in Bordalo et al. (2022).
