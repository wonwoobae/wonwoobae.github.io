Welcome to my homepage!
I am a Ph.D. applicant in economics for the 2023-2024 cycle.

My fields of interests lie broadly in theoretical and applied econometrics, macroeconomics, behavioral economics, and experimental economics. I am especially interested in the topic of expectation formation in economics.

I hold a B.A. in Economics and a B.S. in Mathematics from Seoul National University (2021). I am expecting an M.A. in Economics from Seoul National University (2023).
