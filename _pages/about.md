**[Testing for Almost Stochastic Dominance]** (with Yoon-Jae Whang). 2023. <br/>

We propose a nonparametric test for the null hypothesis of almost stochastic dominance (ASD). The traditional stochastic dominance (SD) rule ranks distributions for <i>all</i> utility functions in a certain class, which can be restrictive in practice. To circumvent the limitation of the SD rule, Leshno and Levy (2002) developed the ASD rule that applies to <i>most</i> rather than <i>all</i> decision makers by eliminating economically pathological preferences. The ASD rule can be applied to many empirical economic problems including investment decisions and policy evaluations. Despite its usefulness, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no formal test of ASD available in the literature. In this paper, we propose an $L_{p}$-type test statistic based on empirical distribution functions and introduce bootstrap procedures to compute the critical values. We investigate the finite sample performance of the testing procedures by a set of Monte Carlo simulation experiments. We apply our test to compare return distributions of stocks and bonds over different investment horizons. The ASD tests support the popular practice of adjusting the portfolios of stocks and bonds based on the investment horizons.
