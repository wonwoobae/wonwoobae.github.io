Welcome to my homepage! I am an economics Ph.D. applicant for the 2023-2024 cycle.

My fields of interests include theoretical and applied econometrics, behavioral economics, macroeconomics, and experimental economics. I am especially interested in the topic of expectation formation in economics.

I hold a B.A. in Economics and a B.S. in Mathematical Sciences from Seoul National University (2021). I am currently an economics M.A. student at Seoul National University.
